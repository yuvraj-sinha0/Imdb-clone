# Ymdb-clone 
Demo:- https://yuvraj00001.git-clone/hub.io/Imdb
ðŸ”´This project is a small clone of IMDB.
ðŸ”´ You can search for any movie and get details of the movie.
ðŸ”´ You can create your customized favorite movie list.
ðŸ”´ The most important thing about this project is it makes use of local storage of your browser which means if you accidentally close the tab or entire window, the list you created is not gone. When you revisit the page you find it same as you left.
ðŸ”´ The movie in the list is deleted only when you personally delete it from the list.
ðŸ”´It also remembers what did you search for last time.
